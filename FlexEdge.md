# Flex Edge
A rules-lite role playing game by Squidhead Games.

## CHARACTER CREATION
1. Pick a name and list 4 things the character is skilled at.  
   **Examples**: Swords, Bows, Magic, Sneaking, Intimidation,
   Engineering, Healing, Diplomacy, Riding, Piloting, Shooting,
   Hacking, Fixing Things, Navigation.

3. Assign points to each of their skills: 1,1,1,2.  
   **Examples**: Swords 2, Fighting 1, Intimidation 1, Gambling 1

4. List 4 things the character is carrying. Assume they have the basic
   necessities for adventuring in the setting. The 4 things listed are
   in addition to everyday items.  
   **Examples**: Sword, Dice, Good Luck Charm, Knife

6. Set the character's health to 5.

### ADVANCEMENT
Add 1 to an existing skill (maximum of 3) or pick a new skill which 
starts at 1.

## RULES
One player is the Game Master (GM). The GM describes the world and controls 
the Non Player Characters (NPCs). The other players create characters (PCs) 
that inhabit the world. The players describe how their PCs react to the world 
and if what they are trying to do is risky or the outcome isn't clear, the GM 
will call for a test.

### DICE
Each player needs 3d6 of one size/color (Check Dice) and 3d6 to 6d6 of another 
size/color (Edge Dice).

### THE TEST
When a character attempts something risky or uncertain, the GM calls for a 
test:

1. Add Check Dice to the pool based on the situation:
   - Disadvantage: 1d6
   - Normal: 2d6
   - Advantage: 3d6

2. Add Edge Dice to the pool if the character is skilled:
   - Add Edge Dice equal to their skill score
   - Example: Swords 2 adds 2d6 Edge Dice

3. Roll all dice together. Success occurs when:
   - Any Check Die shows 5+, or
   - Any Edge Die shows 6

### ENHANCED EQUIPMENT
Most equipment is mundane and simply allows characters to perform actions. Enhanced 
equipment adds additional Edge Dice to the pool.

| Quality    | Basic | Advanced | Next-Level |
|------------|-------|----------|------------|
| Edge Dice  | +1    | +2       | +3         |

Advanced equipment is rare. Next-Level equipment is very rare and expensive.

### ARMOR/SHIELDS
Some settings have armor and/or shields. Spending 1 armor point negates all damage 
from one hit. Armor points refresh at the end of combat. Shields provide +1 armor 
point and must be repaired after use.

| Armor Level | Basic | Advanced |
|-------------|-------|----------|
| Points      | 1     | 2        |

Advanced armor is very rare and very expensive.

### DAMAGE
Each successful combat test deals 1 point of damage. Deal 2 points of damage when 
rolling 3+ successes (each 5+ on Check Dice and each 6 on Edge Dice counts as a 
success).

### OPPONENTS
Opponents follow the same rules as characters but with health and Edge Dice based 
on their difficulty:

| Difficulty  | Easy      | Moderate  | Hard        | Very Hard |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Health      | 1-3       | 4-7       | 8-10        | 11+       |

| Level       | Unskilled | Beginner  | Intermediate| Advanced  |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Edge Dice   | 0         | 1         | 2           | 3         |

Opponents may also have enhanced gear adding additional Edge Dice.
