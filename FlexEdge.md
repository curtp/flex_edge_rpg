### ADVANCEMENT
Add 1 to an existing skill (maximum of 3) or pick a new skill which 
starts at 1.

## RULES
One player is the Game Master (GM). The GM describes the world and controls 
the Non Player Characters (NPCs). The other players create characters (PCs) 
that inhabit the world. The players describe how their PCs react to the world 
and if what they are trying to do is risky or the outcome isn't clear, the GM 
will call for a test.

### DICE
Each player needs 3d6 of one size/color (Check Dice) and 3d6 to 6d6 of another 
size/color (Edge Dice).

### THE TEST
When a character attempts something risky or uncertain, the GM calls for a 
test:

1. Add up to 3 Check Dice to the pool based on the situation:
   - Disadvantage: 1d6
   - Normal: 2d6
   - Advantage: 3d6

2. Add up to 3 Edge Dice to the pool if the character has an applicable skill:
   - Example: Swords 2 adds 2d6 Edge Dice

3. Add up to 3 Edge Dice to the pool if the character has applicable gear:
   - Example: An Advanced sword adds 2d6 Edge Dice

4. Roll all dice together. Success occurs when:
   - Any Check Die shows 5+, or
   - Any Edge Die shows 6

### ENHANCED EQUIPMENT
Most equipment is mundane and simply allows characters to perform actions. Enhanced 
equipment adds additional Edge Dice to the pool.

| Quality    | Basic | Advanced | Next-Level |
|------------|-------|----------|------------|
| Edge Dice  | +1    | +2       | +3         |

Advanced equipment is rare. Next-Level equipment is very rare and expensive.

### ARMOR/SHIELDS
Some settings have armor and/or shields. Spending 1 armor point negates all damage 
from one hit. Armor points refresh at the end of combat. Shields provide +1 armor 
point and must be repaired after use.

| Armor Level | Basic | Advanced |
|-------------|-------|----------|
| Points      | 1     | 2        |

Advanced armor is very rare and very expensive.

### DAMAGE
Each successful combat test deals 1 point of damage. Deal 2 points of damage when 
rolling 3+ successes (each 5+ on Check Dice and each 6 on Edge Dice counts as a 
success).

### OPPONENTS
Opponents follow the same rules as characters but with health based on their 
difficulty and Edge Dice based on their skill level:

| Difficulty  | Easy      | Moderate  | Hard        | Very Hard |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Health      | 1-3       | 4-7       | 8-10        | 11+       |

| Level       | Unskilled | Beginner  | Intermediate| Advanced  |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Edge Dice   | 0         | 1         | 2           | 3         |

Opponents may also have enhanced gear adding additional Edge Dice. To make them
even more challenging, give them armor and a shield.

To scale opponents based on party size, consider adding 1 or 2 health for each PC.
